Mechanisms for achieving good tempo

---

- Boyd: OODA loop
  - What does "getting inside" an OODA loop entail?
  - Owning speed and tempo:
    - Move many things to intuitive action and operating without oversight
    - Build common outlook and orientation to enable intuitive action
    - Shatter ideology, dogma
    - Use scientific process to identify and internalize new intuitive action
      - But do it rapidly and empower the whole organization!
      - Kaizen
  - Disrupting opponent speed and tempo:
    - Be more innovative and counter intuition suddenly (zheng and qi)
    - Create disruption to prevent learning cycles from completing
  - Actually using the speed and tempo!
    - Don't merely learn, employ and evolve
    - Don't merely disrupt, but take advantage and disrupt further

## Fast Transients

- Fighters that *gain* and *lose* energy quickly
- Fighters that out-turn the enemy
- Fighters with *fast transients* which lead to achieving advantages

> Such activity will make us appear ambiguous
> (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder
> among our adversariesâ€”since our adversaries will be
> unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree
> with the menacing as well as faster transient rhythm or
> patterns they are competing against.

## Choosing actions which increase tempo

- Decide actions not merely which create the best exploitation but those that
  set up fast future tempo
- Or, adversarially, choose actions which extend the enemy's time scale, reduce
  their tempo, introduce uncertainty, erode intuition

- Key to this is variety and rapidity
- Key to this is harmonizing actions, having small pieces build large effect
- Key to this is initiative, making the choices and denying initiative and
  choice of the enemy

---

## Principal focus and *qi*

- Decisive, surprising action shatters enemy confidence
- This requires a *principal focus* pairing strength against weakness
- In a business context, this is a *competitive advantage*, but it need not be
  persistent; once it's exploited, the next step needs to be intuitively acted
  upon

---

## Unequal distribution

- Historical studies of battles demonstrates that smaller forces can win over
  larger forces by employing unequal distribution of force
  - Focusing on a small point to break formation
  - "Swirling" light troops which arouse and then retreat create a distraction
    which exposes flanks
  - Hidden reserves misdirect where the unequal application of strength lies

- Rigid uniformity === death

---

## So why do we ever seek rigid uniformity?

- Strength in numbers?
  - Measuring the wrong thing (numbers) leads to inflated perception that size
    is important
  - But management overhead will be difficult to resolve
    - Stress gets taken out on the nervous system of the organization
    - Requires C&C management sooner than later
      - OODA loop stagnates

---

## Plan and counterplan, strategy and counterstrategy

- One way to get inside of the OODA loop is to already have intuitive response
  to actions taken by the opponent
  - Deep *reading* can lead to unnatural preparedness
  - Must be translated to intuition to be used by an organization or in decisive
    strikes
- Deep reading is painful and expensive!
  - Auxilliary observation actions can be used to simplify plans, reducing
    potential branches
  - Similarly, non-uniformity on leads to lessened effectiveness of opponents
    observations, increasing reading costs

---

## Harassment as observation

- Detailed harassment not only slows the opponent's OODA loop, it also produces
  experimental evidence of the highest caliber toward the enemy's weakness
  - Chink in armor

---

## Grand tactics suggest loss of intuitive, local control

- If you have a big cannon, you want to use it
- To use it, you have to centralize command to make decisions about how to use
  the big cannon
- *Result*: initiative is lost once the cannon is used! 
  - The enemy is damaged, but attacks from here on out are predictable
  - Friendly OODA loop was slowed

---

## Top-down perspective leads to top-down control leads to loss of initiative

- Generals who see the battle or war as arising from C&C are less able to
  emphasize geurilla activity and lose access to tools to both inflate (local)
  tempo and extend (global) time scales for opponent.
- Top-down work means there is global structure which means the opponent can
  understand what to expect!
  - This empowers their orientation activities!
